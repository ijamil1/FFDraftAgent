- Outlook: Deep-league dart with upside for a few big weeks; not a reliable weekly starter.

Christian Kirk, HOU, WR, ADP: 152.30
- Upside: Slot reliability and strong rapport with C.J. Stroud — expected to be a stable target and PPR contributor.
- Risk: Coming off a broken collarbone in 2024; crowded WR group in Houston could cap targets.
- Outlook: Solid WR3 with weekly floor and upside to finish as a reliable WR2 in PPR formats if healthy.

Bhayshul Tuten, NYG, RB, ADP: 157.20
- Upside: Athletic rookie (Virginia Tech) with breakout college production and potential to carve a role as a change-of-pace runner.
- Risk: Late-round rookie with limited path to consistent early-down work; likely to face a learning curve.
- Outlook: Deep bench stasher and dynasty dart — draft only if you want upside on the cheap and can carry developmental players.


Most Likely Top 10 Players Available in Round 11:

Ka'imi Fairbairn, HOU, K, ADP: 169.50

- Outlook: Top-tier kicker if healthy; otherwise, avoid early selection until his availability is confirmed.

Rico Dowdle, CAR, RB, ADP: 185.20
- Upside: Coming off a 1,000-yard season and now signed with Carolina; capable change-of-pace with receiving chops.
- Risk: Will likely be in a timeshare with Chuba Hubbard, which reduces week-to-week ceiling.

Round 13: Keeper used in this round (no specific players listed)


Most Likely Top 10 Players Available in Round 14:

Roschon Johnson, CHI, RB, ADP: 230.80
- Upside: Touchdown-dependent scoring specialist with a proven nose-for-the-goal-line in 2024; could command short-yardage work under new coach Ben Johnson.
- Risk: Injury history (foot issues, concussions) and competition for snaps could limit season-long reliability.
- Outlook: Late-round dart with sneaky TD upside — roster as depth/handcuff with potential to pay off in short-yardage situations.

Keaton Mitchell, BAL, RB, ADP: 242.00
- Upside: Electric speed and home-run ability; off a strong recovery from a major knee injury and reportedly looks explosive again in OTAs.
- Risk: Limited role behind Derrick Henry and Justice Hill; small sample of carries since return from injury creates uncertainty.
- Outlook: High-upside handcuff/returner with upside on special teams; target as a late-round developmental piece.

D.J. Giddens, IND, RB, ADP: 241.30
- Upside: Rookie with a strong college production profile (two 1,200+ seasons) and a reliable between-the-tackles runner for the Colts.
- Risk: Rookie adjustment and depth chart competition with Jonathan Taylor and Tyler Goodson reduce immediate workload.
- Outlook: High-upside rookie stash for dynasty and redraft depth; could earn late-season snaps if injuries occur or role expands.

Miles Sanders, DAL, RB, ADP: 243.80
- Upside: Proven multi-year production with a track record of success in committee roles; offers receiving chops and touchdown upside.
- Risk: Crowded backfield in Dallas (Javonte Williams, Jaydon Blue, Deuce Vaughn) makes weekly role uncertain.
- Outlook: Useful depth piece with upside if he wins early snaps; safer as a handcuff/backup in redraft leagues.

Will Shipley, PHI, RB, ADP: 228.00
- Upside: Versatile pass-catching back with special teams upside and previous All-ACC production — fits well in Philly’s offense as a compliment.
- Risk: Limited early-down work behind top-tier starters and rookie status could cap immediate fantasy value.
- Outlook: Late-round flex/handcuff target with PPR appeal — stashable for midseason upside.

New England Patriots (DST), N/A, DST, ADP: 215.80
- Upside: Disciplined scheme and opportunistic coaching can generate timely turnovers and sacks; improved pass rush in offseason increased upside.
- Risk: Offense inconsistency and low turnovers league-wide can cap big single-week scoring.
- Outlook: Streamable DST with a few high-ceiling matchups; roster as a matchup play rather than a weekly lock.

Washington Commanders (DST), N/A, DST, ADP: 214.70
- Upside: Emerging pass-rush weapons and improved secondary create upside for sacks and takeaways.
- Risk: Offensive inconsistencies and aggressive play-calling can sometimes leave defense on the field longer, creating fatigue.
- Outlook: Mid-tier DST with matchup-dependent upside; season-long starter only in stronger matchups.

Cleveland Browns (DST), N/A, DST, ADP: 217.00
- Upside: Strong front-seven and turnover-generating potential provide sack upside and defensive TD chances.
- Risk: Opponents’ offensive strengths and game script variability can reduce consistent DST scoring.

Los Angeles Rams (DST), N/A, DST, ADP: 220.80
- Upside: Rebuilt defensive line and veteran secondary talent offer a path to sacks and turnovers in favorable weeks.

- Outlook: Matchup-based DST with a few big-week potential games — roster as a streamer.

Raheem Mostert, LV, RB, ADP: 221.80
- Upside: Proven touchdown scorer and efficient runner (career 5.0 YPC); reunited with OC Chip Kelly, which could unlock explosiveness.
- Risk: Age (turning 33 in April 2025), injury history, and a crowded Raiders backfield could reduce volume.
- Outlook: High-upside late-round handcuff/rotational back — good touchdown upside if given goal-line work and manageable risk as a depth piece.

Draft strategies with keepers (Drake London — WR, used in Round 3; Kyren Williams — RB, used in Round 13)
Generated: 2025-08-26
Appended strategies for pick 8 (14-team snake), using the Monte Carlo availability lists.

Strategy A — Balanced / RB-first with secured WR base (recommended)
- Core idea: You already have a starting WR kept in Round 3 (Drake London). Prioritize securing at least one high-usage RB early (Rounds 1–2) while mixing in a high-upside WR if the right RB is gone. Kyren Williams kept in Round 13 gives late RB depth, so load RBs early–mid.
- Draft-plan (concise):
  - Round 1 (pick 8): Target a volume RB (Josh Jacobs, Jonathan Taylor) or, if they’re gone, take a high-floor WR (Amon‑Ra St. Brown / Tyreek Hill / A.J. Brown).
  - Round 2: If you got RB1 in R1, target a high-upside WR (Marvin Harrison Jr., Garrett Wilson, Davante Adams). If you took WR in R1, double-down on RB (Kenneth Walker III, Chuba Hubbard, Breece Hall).
  - Round 3: Keeper used — Drake London fills your WR3 slot and gives you target floor in PPR weeks.
  - Rounds 4–6: Draft a reliable TE if available (Mark Andrews, George Kittle) or add RB depth (Jaylen Warren, Travis Etienne) and high-floor WRs (Cooper Kupp, Jakobi Meyers).
  - Mid rounds (7–10): Grab committee busters/handcuffs (Zach Charbonnet, J.K. Dobbins), one QB if value (Brock Purdy), and a DST/kicker late.
  - Late rounds: Kyren Williams is already a late keeper (R13) — treat him as bench depth/bye insurance; target upside RBs and rookie WRs for upside.
- Players to prioritize (targets by priority):
  1) RBs: Josh Jacobs, Jonathan Taylor, Kenneth Walker III, Josh Jacobs (repeat), Jaylen Warren, Travis Etienne
  2) WRs: Amon‑Ra St. Brown, Marvin Harrison Jr., Garrett Wilson, Davante Adams, Cooper Kupp
  3) TE/QB timing: Take TE early only if a clear top option falls (McBride/Andrews/Kittle); QB late unless a top-tier passer slips
- Why this works: Drake London gives stable WR snaps and Kyren Williams gives late RB depth — filling the highest-variance position (RB) early reduces bust risk while still leaving room for high-upside WRs.
- In-draft tips: Always roster one handcuff to your starters (especially RBs); if a workhorse RB falls within reach, grab him even if it means deviating from ADP.


Strategy B — Uncorrelated alternative: Zero-RB / Heavy WR + early TE (contrarian)
- Core idea: With Drake London locked in (Round 3) you can pivot to locking elite volume and target share at WR and TE early, then attack RB depth mid-to-late. This reduces correlation with RB-running strategies and benefits PPR formats.
- Draft-plan (concise):
  - Round 1 (pick 8): Prioritize elite WR upside (Amon‑Ra St. Brown, Tyreek Hill, A.J. Brown) or grab a top TE-if-available (Trey McBride if TE is scoring and you value positional advantage).
  - Round 2: Double-down on WR/TE (Marvin Harrison Jr., Garrett Wilson, George Kittle) — build 2–3 starting WRs before taking your first RB.
  - Round 3: Keeper used — Drake London boosts your target floor; you now start the season with 3 WRs or 2 WR + TE advantage.
  - Rounds 4–7: Wait on RBs — prioritize high-ceiling WRs and a top TE if you didn’t get one earlier; pick RBs in the mid rounds who project to 3-down roles or have pass-catching value (Jaylen Warren, Rhamondre Stevenson later)
  - Late rounds: Load RB depth and upside handcuffs (rookies and committee guys). Kyren Williams (R13 keeper) gives end-of-roster RB depth, so you can be selective with mid-late RBs.
- Players to prioritize (targets by priority):
  1) WRs: Amon‑Ra St. Brown, Marvin Harrison Jr., Garrett Wilson, Stefon Diggs, Cooper Kupp
  2) TEs: Trey McBride (early), Mark Andrews, George Kittle (if you want positional advantage)
  3) RBs (mid/late): Jaylen Warren, Travis Etienne, Zach Charbonnet, Austin Ekeler (if he slips), Damien/handcuffs in rounds 9–14
- Why this works: You lock target share and weekly floor via Drake London + two early WRs/TE advantage; running backs in 2025 have high injury risk and late emergence — Kyren Williams provides emergency RB depth, so you can buy RB value later.
- In-draft tips: Don’t panic if RB value is low early — use best-player-available at WR/TE to build weekly consistency. Prioritize pass-catching RBs when you do start drafting RBs to protect PPR floor.
