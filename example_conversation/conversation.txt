You: let's mock draft
Agent: Great — I can run a mock draft for you. I just need a few inputs (or I can use sensible defaults). Required parameters:

1) Number of teams (e.g., 12) — required.  
2) Your draft pick number (1 through num_teams) — required.  
3) Number of draft rounds (must be 14–16) — required.  
4) ADP CSV file path (absolute path) OR I can retrieve the ADP data for you (I’ll call the built-in ADP fetch which pulls FantasyPros data; note that retrieval can fail because pages change). — required (either you supply path or ask me to fetch).  
Optional:
- Keepers CSV absolute path (if you have keepers). Format required: Player, Position, Round, Team.  
- Number of simulations to run (default I suggest 2000).

Before I run the simulation I’ll confirm the parameters with you. If you want defaults, I propose: 12 teams, your pick 6, 15 rounds, 2000 sims, and I’ll fetch the ADP file. Do you want those defaults, or please give: num_teams, pick, draft_rounds, whether I should fetch ADP (or provide path), any keepers file path, and num_sims.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
You: 14 teams; pick 8; 14 rounds; get the ADP data for me; keepers: /Users/irfanjamil/FF_Draft_Assistant/keepers.csv ; 2500 simulations
System: Agent wants to call: get_adp_data with args {}
System: Agent wants to call: run_draft_simulation with args {'num_teams': 14, 'pick': 8, 'draft_rounds': 14, 'adp_csv_file': '/Users/irfanjamil/FF_Draft_Assistant/adp_data.csv', 'keepers_csv_file': '/Users/irfanjamil/FF_Draft_Assistant/keepers.csv', 'num_sims': 2500}
Agent: Got it — I started the mock draft using the parameters you gave.

Summary of what I used
- Teams: 14  
- Your pick: 8  
- Rounds: 14  
- ADP data: fetched from FantasyPros and saved to /Users/irfanjamil/FF_Draft_Assistant/adp_data.csv  
- Keepers file: /Users/irfanjamil/FF_Draft_Assistant/keepers.csv  
- Simulations: 2,500

Simulation status
- Job ID: 085e8305-73fd-4f45-9a74-8ba9eb6cfba3  
- Status: started (running in the background)

Next steps
- This can take a few minutes. When you want the results, tell me "check simulation 085e8305..." or simply "check draft results" and I’ll fetch the status/results for that job.  
- If you want to change any parameter (teams, pick, rounds, sims, ADP source, or keepers), let me know — changing requires running a new simulation.

Would you like me to check the job status now or wait and notify you when it finishes?


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
You: can you check the status?
System: Agent wants to call: get_simulation_status_and_results with args {'job_id': '085e8305-73fd-4f45-9a74-8ba9eb6cfba3'}
Agent: The simulation is still running (status: running) — job ID 085e8305-73fd-4f45-9a74-8ba9eb6cfba3. 

I can check again whenever you like; would you like me to poll it every minute until it finishes, or should I check back when you ask?


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
You: can you tell me more about the simulation?
System: Agent wants to call: read_simulation_file with args {}
Agent: Good — I opened the simulation code and here’s a concise, clear explanation of how the mock-draft works, what assumptions it makes, and what the output means.

High-level summary
- Inputs the simulator uses: num_teams, pick (your draft position), draft_rounds (14–16), an ADP CSV (Player, Position, ADP; sorted by ADP), optional keepers CSV (Player, Position, Round, Team), and num_sims.  
- It runs num_sims independent simulated snake drafts in parallel, then aggregates counts to produce, for each round, the most-likely top-10 players that will still be available at your pick (shown as % of simulations).  
- Current running job: 14 teams, your pick 8, 14 rounds, ADP file: /Users/irfanjamil/FF_Draft_Assistant/adp_data.csv, keepers: /Users/irfanjamil/FF_Draft_Assistant/keepers.csv, 2,500 sims, job ID 085e8305-73fd-4f45-9a74-8ba9eb6cfba3.

Key mechanics and heuristics (what actually determines picks)
- Team roster templates: For a 14-team draft the code randomly assigns each team one roster template (from TEAM_COMPOSITION_14). Each template lists how many players that team should end up with at each position (order: QB,RB,WR,TE,K,DST). This models different team construction targets and creates positional need variance across teams.  
- Positional constraints: before a pick, a team computes which positions are “full” (no slots left) and marks those positions unavailable. Additional heuristics:
  - If a team has 2 more WRs than RBs, WRs are blocked (and vice versa).
  - Early in the build, if a team has <1 QB or <1 TE, DST/K are blocked (so teams don’t draft DST/K early).
  - If a team already has 1 QB (or 1 TE) but lacks 3 RBs or 3 WRs, it blocks drafting a 2nd QB (or 2nd TE) until more RB/WR depth is in place.
- ADP ordering + stochastic selection: the available player pool is the ADP-sorted list with keepers removed. For each pick the simulator builds an array of available (by position and not already picked) players, then samples an index using a discretized Pareto distribution (alpha randomly drawn between 1.4 and 2.3 for each sample). That biases picks toward the top of the ADP list but leaves a heavy tail for surprises. Practically: picks are sampled from approximately the top ~25 available players (x_max = min(25, available_count)), giving realistic variance while staying ADP-driven.
- Your pick behavior: at every round where you pick, the simulator records the top-10 available players (the 10 highest-ranked-by-ADP players that pass positional filters) for that simulation before making the actual pick. These recorded top-10 entries are what get counted across simulations to produce the “Most Likely Top 10 Players Available in Round X” output.
- Keepers: keepers are read, validated, applied to team rosters ahead of the draft (their positions increment team composition and their pick rounds are marked). Keeper players are removed from the ADP pool by matching a normalized player name string.
- Aggregation & output: after all simulations the script counts how often each recorded player-string appears for each round, sorts by frequency, and prints the top 10 players per round with percent available = (count / num_sims) * 100 and the ADP from the ADP file.

Implementation / performance notes
- Runs simulations in parallel with ProcessPoolExecutor; runtime scales with num_sims and number of CPU cores.  
- Validations are strict: ADP column must be float64, Position values must match the Position enum (QB,RB,WR,TE,K,DST), ADP file must contain the required columns. If the ADP file lacks a Team column, NFL team is printed as N/A.  
- Name normalization: the script strips non-alphanumeric characters and lowercases names to match keepers against ADP list. This usually works but can mis-match edge cases (e.g., suffixes/licenses, duplicate names).
- Limitations / what it does not model:
  - No week-to-week scoring, bye week conflicts, or depth-chart changes.  
  - No dynamic ADP updates based on in-draft trends (only the initial ADP ordering + stochastic sampling).  
  - No injury or news updates — the ADP file is assumed current before the run.  
  - Roster templates are sampled from a fixed list (TEAM_COMPOSITION_14, etc.), so team-building behavior is limited to those templates and the implemented heuristics.
  - The “top-10 available” lists reflect ADP ordering and positional filters at your pick, not other advanced projections (targets, air yards, etc.).

Where you can tweak or what I can do next
- Increase / decrease num_sims (more sims = smoother % estimates, longer runtime).  
- Change draft_rounds (14–16 supported).  
- Provide a different ADP file or update keepers.  
- I can show the exact lines of code for any function (generate_pick, sample_discrete_pareto, etc.) if you want deeper detail — I already loaded simulate.py.  
- I can: (A) poll the current job again and return results when it finishes, (B) stop this job and start a new simulation with different parameters, or (C) run a quick smaller test (e.g., 200 sims) to demonstrate output immediately.

Which would you like me to do now? (Check job status again, wait and fetch results when done, run a small quick demo, or explain a specific function/line in the code?)

What would you like to do next?
- Save these results to a file (I can create a CSV or text file).  
- Run follow-up analysis (e.g., which players are best to target from rounds 1–5 given pick 8; positional strategy recommendations).  
- Re-run with different params (more/less sims, different ADP, change keepers).  
- I can also pull live player news/projections for any players you want more detail on (I’ll fetch current sources).

Agent: Done — I saved the results to /Users/irfanjamil/FF_Draft_Assistant/monte_carlo_draft_results.md.

Anything else you'd like added to the file (charts, CSV export, or a short takeaway/strategy summary for pick 8)?


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
You: sure, let's do some research into each distinct player in the result set. Here's what I want you to do: compile a report that consists of a few bullet points per player. The bullet points should capture the player's upsides, risks, and outlook. Please be up-to-date with the information. I want the report to be saved to a file called ff_research_report.md. The format of the report should be similar to the format of the results you just saved except now there should be bullet points directly underneath each player. 
Agent: I can do that — but it’s a fairly large research job (many players). A couple quick questions so I proceed the way you want:

1) Scope & pacing — do you want me to research every distinct player from the simulation all at once, or work in batches? Options:
   - A. All players (I’ll fetch everything, but I’ll do it in batches and save progress to the file as I go). This will take longer.
   - B. Priority players only (you pick which rounds or specific players to start with — e.g., Rounds 1–4 or top 30 players).
   - C. I start with Round 1–3 (fast first pass) and continue after you review.

2) Format confirmation — I’ll follow your requested structure: for each player line (Player, Team, Pos, ADP) I’ll add bullets for:
   - Upsides (2–3 bullets)
   - Risks (2–3 bullets)
   - Outlook (1–2 bullets / brief paragraph)
   I’ll include citations (sources) for each player’s load-bearing points and add them inline below the player bullets.

3) File & saving — I will create ff_research_report.md in /Users/irfanjamil/FF_Draft_Assistant/ (same folder as the previous file) and append batches as they finish. Confirm that filename and location are OK.

If you’re happy with those defaults, tell me which option for scope (A, B, or C). Once you confirm, I’ll start the first web searches and create the file with the first batch.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
You: work in batches. Maybe 1 bullet for each of upsides, risks, and outlook is enough (max 2). Each player should have 3-5 bullets maximum. Citations are not needed in the report. Use reputable and reliable sources but I don't need the sources listed explicitly. The file name and location are perfect
Agent: Got it — I’ll work in batches and save the report as /Users/irfanjamil/FF_Draft_Assistant/ff_research_report.md.

Quick clarifying question before I start:
- Which batch should I do first? I suggest starting with Round 1–3 (the 20 distinct players from Rounds 1–2; Round 3 shows a keeper). Is that OK, or would you prefer a smaller batch (e.g., top 10 players) instead?

One more note:
- I must look up each player on the web to be up-to-date. You said you don’t want citations in the file — that’s fine; I’ll still use reputable sources (ESPN, CBS, Yahoo, NFL.com, PFF) but I won’t list them in the report unless you later ask for sources.

Reply “Start with R1–R3” (or tell me a different batch) and I’ll begin and save the first batch to ff_research_report.md.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
You: perfect; start with R1-R3

(Explosive contested-catch and touchdown upside.)\n- Risk: Durability concerns — has missed significant time in recent seasons which suppresses weekly floor.\n- Outlook: High-upside WR2/3 with WR1 ceiling if he stays healthy and Joe Burrow stays healthy.\n\nA.J. Brown, PHI, WR, ADP: 20.00\n- Upside: Elite efficiency and contested-catch ability; can post top-12 WR numbers even in a run-leaning Eagles offense.\n- Risk: Injury history and team run-heavy scheme limit target volume some weeks.\n- Outlook: Reliable high-floor WR1 candidate — draft early expecting steady production and occasional boom weeks.\n\nTrey McBride, ARI, TE, ADP: 27.30\n- Upside: Clear top-tier TE target share and volume after a breakout season; high target floor at the position.\n- Risk: Low touchdown totals to date; red-zone scoring volatility could cap ceiling.\n- Outlook: Strong TE1 pick — borderline elite if touchdown luck improves; safe weekly starter.\n\nLamar Jackson, BAL, QB, ADP: 21.50\n- Upside: Top-tier rushing floor for QBs and big-play passing ability — high fantasy ceiling.\n- Risk: Running-related injury risk (legs/ankles); any missed time severely impacts fantasy value.\n- Outlook: High-end QB1 when healthy; consider as a top QB if you prioritize ceiling and rushing upside.\n\nJosh Allen, BUF, QB, ADP: 20.80\n- Upside: Elite passing volume and rushing contributions make him a weekly top scorer and high floor QB1.\n- Risk: High draft capital cost and occasional TD-skewed weeks; rare injury or game script changes affect ceiling.\n- Outlook: Clear top-2 QB — dependable high ceiling and floor for fantasy rosters.\n\nJonathan Taylor, IND, RB, ADP: 19.80\n- Upside: Bell-cow rushing volume and touchdown upside when the Colts lean on the run; high carry totals.\n- Risk: Past injuries and occasional limited receiving work cap some PPR upside.\n- Outlook: Strong RB1 candidate in standard and solid-floor RB1 in PPR if volume holds.\n\nTyreek Hill, MIA, WR, ADP: 32.20\n- Upside: Elite separation and big-play upside; bounce-back candidate after an inefficient 2024 if healthy.\n- Risk: Age (31 in 2025) and recent wrist issues could limit efficiency; quarterback/chemistry concerns possible.\n- Outlook: High-ceiling WR1 with boom-bust weeks — target as a top-12 receiver with upside to finish higher.\n\nJosh Jacobs, GB, RB, ADP: 16.20\n- Upside: Clear lead-back role with heavy volume and goal-line work — strong RB1 value.\n- Risk: Workload and wear; offensive line and game script can influence efficiency.\n- Outlook: Reliable RB1/2 with RB1 upside; early-round mainstay if you want volume-driven production.\n\nAmon-Ra St. Brown, DET, WR, ADP: 9.30\n- Upside: High target share and route-volume machine — elite weekly floor in PPR formats.\n- Risk: Surrounding weapons and quarterback play can cap upside; some matchup sensitivity.\n- Outlook: Locked-in WR1 for weekly lineups with high floor and modest ceiling relative to elite explosive WRs.\n\nAshton Jeanty, LV, RB, ADP: 10.30\n- Upside: Rookie upside in a Raiders offense lacking a proven, high-usage back — early-down and goal-line candidate.\n- Risk: Rookie growing pains and committee chances can limit immediate ceiling.\n- Outlook: High-upside rookie RB target — draft as bounce/swing for upside in later first/early second range.\n\n\nMost Likely Top 10 Players Available in Round 2:\n\nMarvin Harrison Jr., ARI, WR, ADP: 41.00\n- Upside: Elite route-running and target profile; enormous touchdown and yardage ceiling as he develops with Kyler Murray.\n- Risk: Elevated expectations after rookie season and possible target competition (McBride, Michael Wilson).\n- Outlook: High-upside WR2 with breakout potential in Year 2; safe long-term dynasty asset and high-upside redraft pick.\n\nChuba Hubbard, CAR, RB, ADP: 45.50\n- Upside: Established 2024 workhorse with clear lead-back ability and new contract/security.\n- Risk: Injury history (finished 2024 on IR) and added competition in backfield may reduce touches.\n- Outlook: RB2 with upside — draft expecting volume but keep an eye on health and new backfield pieces.\n\nKenneth Walker III, SEA, RB, ADP: 40.70\n- Upside: Explosive runner with home-run ability and solid role in Seahawks' offense when healthy.\n- Risk: Durability concerns and the presence of other backs (Charbonnet) could reduce ceiling.\n- Outlook: High-upside RB2 — useful as a flex or high-upside RB2 depending on draft cost.\n\nGarrett Wilson, NYJ, WR, ADP: 39.70\n- Upside: Strong target volume and rapport with his QB; safe PPR floor with WR1 weeks possible.\n- Risk: Offense schematics and new coaching direction could cap ceiling; less explosive than elite WRs.\n- Outlook: Reliable WR2/high-floor WR1 candidate — pick for consistency and target volume.\n\nDavante Adams, LAR, WR, ADP: 39.30\n- Upside: Elite route-running and red-zone prowess; still a top-tier volume receiver in a Rams passing game.\n- Risk: Age and health plus offense changes may reduce ceiling compared to peak years.\n- Outlook: High-floor WR2 with occasional WR1 weeks; strong value if target share holds.\n\nMike Evans, TB, WR, ADP: 38.70\n- Upside: Consistent touchdown producer with size and red-zone role; dependable target in the offense.\n- Risk: Age and hamstring/soft-tissue injuries have cropped up; efficiency can fluctuate with QB play.\n- Outlook: Reliable late-first/early-second WR with touchdown-dependent ceiling; useful as a stable starter.\n\nTreVeyon Henderson, NE, RB, ADP: 47.50\n- Upside: Explosive playmaker and rookie receiving upside in New England’s offense; high upside even in a committee.\n- Risk: Stacked backfield with Rhamondre Stevenson reduces early-down and goal-line upside.\n- Outlook: High-upside RB3/committee piece with standalone flex potential if he carves out role quickly.\n\nBreece Hall, NYJ, RB, ADP: 37.30\n- Upside: Bell-cow talent when healthy with pass-catching chops — strong ceiling in the right system.\n- Risk: Past injuries and Jets' shifting offensive philosophy could limit volume.\n- Outlook: RB2 with RB1 upside if he commands workload; safer than many volatile backs but monitor health.\n\nGeorge Kittle, SF, TE, ADP: 38.00\n- Upside: Elite YAC, consistent red-zone target, and big-play TE production in Kyle Shanahan’s scheme.\n- Risk: Age and injury history (past foot/ankle issues) could cap availability.\n- Outlook: High-end TE1 when healthy; draft as a top tight end with weekly upside.\n\nAlvin Kamara, NO, RB, ADP: 37.00\n- Upside: Pass-catching ability and involvement in the Saints’ offense create PPR value and TD upside.\n- Risk: Legal/news/availability and aging could limit season-long reliability.\n- Outlook: High-variance RB3 with upside in PPR formats if he stays on the field and involved in passing game.\n\n\nRound 3: Keeper used in this round (no player list for this round)\n\n---\n\nNotes on sources and process:\n- Report compiled from up-to-date fantasy previews and team/injury reports (ESPN, CBS, FantasyPros, PFF, NBC Sports, Rotowire) as of 2025-08-26.\n- Each player entry is intentionally short: 1 bullet for Upside, 1 for Risk, 1 for Outlook (occasionally a second Outlook bullet when helpful).\n\nNext steps:\n- If this looks good, I’ll proceed with the next batch (Rounds 4–6). I will continue to save progress to this same file as each batch completes.\n- If you want full source citations for any player or want the entries expanded to two bullets each, say the word and I’ll include them.\n"}
Agent: Done — I created /Users/irfanjamil/FF_Draft_Assistant/ff_research_report.md with the Round 1–3 player research (short bullets: upside, risk, outlook).

I used up-to-date information (sources like ESPN, PFF, CBS, FantasyPros, Rotowire) for each player; if you want, I can:
- Continue with the next batch (Rounds 4–6), or
- Add source citations inline for each player, or
- Expand any player entries to two bullets per category.

Which would you like next?

Agent: Done — I appended the Rounds 10–12 research to /Users/irfanjamil/FF_Draft_Assistant/ff_research_report.md.

Notes and highlights from this batch:
- Tyjae Spears was placed on injured reserve (high-ankle sprain) Aug 26, 2025 — I marked him as a stash and noted missed games.  
- Jason Sanders may have an availability question at the start of the season — flagged for confirmation before drafting kickers.  
- Several late-round names are rookies/developing players (Dylan Sampson, Bhayshul Tuten, Isaac Guerendo, Jayden Higgins, Tre' Harris, etc.). I labeled them as deep-league stashes or upside picks.

Ready to finish the final batch (Rounds 13–14) and then close the report. Want me to proceed?

Giddens, IND, RB, ADP: 241.30\n- Upside: Rookie with a strong college production profile (two 1,200+ seasons) and a reliable between-the-tackles runner for the Colts.\n- Risk: Rookie adjustment and depth chart competition with Jonathan Taylor and Tyler Goodson reduce immediate workload.\n- Outlook: High-upside rookie stash for dynasty and redraft depth; could earn late-season snaps if injuries occur or role expands.\n\nMiles Sanders, DAL, RB, ADP: 243.80\n- Upside: Proven multi-year production with a track record of success in committee roles; offers receiving chops and touchdown upside.\n- Risk: Crowded backfield in Dallas (Javonte Williams, Jaydon Blue, Deuce Vaughn) makes weekly role uncertain.\n- Outlook: Useful depth piece with upside if he wins early snaps; safer as a handcuff/backup in redraft leagues.\n\nWill Shipley, PHI, RB, ADP: 228.00\n- Upside: Versatile pass-catching back with special teams upside and previous All-ACC production — fits well in Philly’s offense as a compliment.\n- Risk: Limited early-down work behind top-tier starters and rookie status could cap immediate fantasy value.\n- Outlook: Late-round flex/handcuff target with PPR appeal — stashable for midseason upside.\n\nNew England Patriots (DST), N/A, DST, ADP: 215.80\n- Upside: Disciplined scheme and opportunistic coaching can generate timely turnovers and sacks; improved pass rush in offseason increased upside.\n- Risk: Offense inconsistency and low turnovers league-wide can cap big single-week scoring.\n- Outlook: Streamable DST with a few high-ceiling matchups; roster as a matchup play rather than a weekly lock.\n\nWashington Commanders (DST), N/A, DST, ADP: 214.70\n- Upside: Emerging pass-rush weapons and improved secondary create upside for sacks and takeaways.\n- Risk: Offensive inconsistencies and aggressive play-calling can sometimes leave defense on the field longer, creating fatigue.\n- Outlook: Mid-tier DST with matchup-dependent upside; season-long starter only in stronger matchups.\n\nCleveland Browns (DST), N/A, DST, ADP: 217.00\n- Upside: Strong front-seven and turnover-generating potential provide sack upside and defensive TD chances.\n- Risk: Opponents’ offensive strengths and game script variability can reduce consistent DST scoring.\n- Outlook: Solid streaming option and mid-tier DST to roster for matchup plays.\n\nLos Angeles Rams (DST), N/A, DST, ADP: 220.80\n- Upside: Rebuilt defensive line and veteran secondary talent offer a path to sacks and turnovers in favorable weeks.\n- Risk: Offense may underperform at times, but Rams' DST can be boom-or-bust depending on matchup.\n- Outlook: Matchup-based DST with a few big-week potential games — roster as a streamer.\n\nRaheem Mostert, LV, RB, ADP: 221.80\n- Upside: Proven touchdown scorer and efficient runner (career 5.0 YPC); reunited with OC Chip Kelly, which could unlock explosiveness.\n- Risk: Age (turning 33 in April 2025), injury history, and a crowded Raiders backfield could reduce volume.\n- Outlook: High-upside late-round handcuff/rotational back — good touchdown upside if given goal-line work and manageable risk as a depth piece.\n\n---\n\nFinal notes:\n- The file now contains researched Upside/Risk/Outlook bullets for all distinct players appearing in the simulation results across Rounds 1–14.

Agent: Finished — I appended Rounds 13–14 and completed the report. The file is saved at /Users/irfanjamil/FF_Draft_Assistant/ff_research_report.md and includes concise Upside / Risk / Outlook bullets for every distinct player in the simulation results.

Next steps you might want:
- Add a strategic summary for drafting at pick 8 (I can append 6–10 quick takeaways).  
- Export this report to CSV or a different format.  
- Ask for sources for any player(s) or expand any entries from 1 bullet to 2 bullets.

What would you like me to do now?

You: ok thanks. Now my keepers are Drake London and Kyren Williams. They are used in round 3 and 13 for me respectively. Drake is a WR and Kyren is a RB. Given this information and the likely players available in each round, give me a draft strategy and players to focus on. In addition to this, give me another strategy that is not correlated with the first one. Be to the point and append these strategies and advice to the report you just created.
System: Agent wants to call: append_file with args {'file_path': '/Users/irfanjamil/FF_Draft_Assistant/ff_research_report.md', 'content_to_append': '\n\n---\n\nDraft strategies with keepers (Drake London — WR, used in Round 3; Kyren Williams — RB, used in Round 13)\nGenerated: 2025-08-26\nAppended strategies for pick 8 (14-team snake), using the Monte Carlo availability lists.\n\nStrategy A — Balanced / RB-first with secured WR base (recommended)\n- Core idea: You already have a starting WR kept in Round 3 (Drake London). Prioritize securing at least one high-usage RB early (Rounds 1–2) while mixing in a high-upside WR if the right RB is gone. Kyren Williams kept in Round 13 gives late RB depth, so load RBs early–mid.\n- Draft-plan (concise):\n  - Round 1 (pick 8): Target a volume RB (Josh Jacobs, Jonathan Taylor) or, if they’re gone, take a high-floor WR (Amon‑Ra St. Brown / Tyreek Hill / A.J. Brown).\n  - Round 2: If you got RB1 in R1, target a high-upside WR (Marvin Harrison Jr., Garrett Wilson, Davante Adams). If you took WR in R1, double-down on RB (Kenneth Walker III, Chuba Hubbard, Breece Hall).\n  - Round 3: Keeper used — Drake London fills your WR3 slot and gives you target floor in PPR weeks.\n  - Rounds 4–6: Draft a reliable TE if available (Mark Andrews, George Kittle) or add RB depth (Jaylen Warren, Travis Etienne) and high-floor WRs (Cooper Kupp, Jakobi Meyers).\n  - Mid rounds (7–10): Grab committee busters/handcuffs (Zach Charbonnet, J.K. Dobbins), one QB if value (Brock Purdy), and a DST/kicker late.\n  - Late rounds: Kyren Williams is already a late keeper (R13) — treat him as bench depth/bye insurance; target upside RBs and rookie WRs for upside.\n- Players to prioritize (targets by priority):\n  1) RBs: Josh Jacobs, Jonathan Taylor, Kenneth Walker III, Josh Jacobs (repeat), Jaylen Warren, Travis Etienne\n  2) WRs: Amon‑Ra St. Brown, Marvin Harrison Jr., Garrett Wilson, Davante Adams, Cooper Kupp\n  3) TE/QB timing: Take TE early only if a clear top option falls (McBride/Andrews/Kittle); QB late unless a top-tier passer slips\n- Why this works: Drake London gives stable WR snaps and Kyren Williams gives late RB depth — filling the highest-variance position (RB) early reduces bust risk while still leaving room for high-upside WRs.\n- In-draft tips: Always roster one handcuff to your starters (especially RBs); if a workhorse RB falls within reach, grab him even if it means deviating from ADP.\n\n\nStrategy B — Uncorrelated alternative: Zero-RB / Heavy WR + early TE (contrarian)\n- Core idea: With Drake London locked in (Round 3) you can pivot to locking elite volume and target share at WR and TE early, then attack RB depth mid-to-late. This reduces correlation with RB-running strategies and benefits PPR formats.\n- Draft-plan (concise):\n  - Round 1 (pick 8): Prioritize elite WR upside (Amon‑Ra St. Brown, Tyreek Hill, A.J. Brown) or grab a top TE-if-available (Trey McBride if TE is scoring and you value positional advantage).\n  - Round 2: Double-down on WR/TE (Marvin Harrison Jr., Garrett Wilson, George Kittle) — build 2–3 starting WRs before taking your first RB.\n  - Round 3: Keeper used — Drake London boosts your target floor; you now start the season with 3 WRs or 2 WR + TE advantage.\n  - Rounds 4–7: Wait on RBs — prioritize high-ceiling WRs and a top TE if you didn’t get one earlier; pick RBs in the mid rounds who project to 3-down roles or have pass-catching value (Jaylen Warren, Rhamondre Stevenson later)\n  - Late rounds: Load RB depth and upside handcuffs (rookies and committee guys). Kyren Williams (R13 keeper) gives end-of-roster RB depth, so you can be selective with mid-late RBs.\n- Players to prioritize (targets by priority):\n  1) WRs: Amon‑Ra St. Brown, Marvin Harrison Jr., Garrett Wilson, Stefon Diggs, Cooper Kupp\n  2) TEs: Trey McBride (early), Mark Andrews, George Kittle (if you want positional advantage)\n  3) RBs (mid/late): Jaylen Warren, Travis Etienne, Zach Charbonnet, Austin Ekeler (if he slips), Damien/handcuffs in rounds 9–14\n- Why this works: You lock target share and weekly floor via Drake London + two early WRs/TE advantage; running backs in 2025 have high injury risk and late emergence — Kyren Williams provides emergency RB depth, so you can buy RB value later.\n- In-draft tips: Don’t panic if RB value is low early — use best-player-available at WR/TE to build weekly consistency. Prioritize pass-catching RBs when you do start drafting RBs to protect PPR floor.\n\n\nAction & file update:\n- I appended these two strategies to the research report at /Users/irfanjamil/FF_Draft_Assistant/ff_research_report.md.\n- Want me to also: (A) produce a one-page cheat sheet for pick-by-pick decisions at your spot (round-by-round “if X is available, take Y”), or (B) generate a printable one-page draft board (top 6–8 targets per round) based on these strategies? Reply which and I’ll append it to the file.\n'}
Agent: Done — I appended both strategies (Balanced RB-first and an uncorrelated Zero-RB/WR-heavy alternative) to /Users/irfanjamil/FF_Draft_Assistant/ff_research_report.md.

If you'd like, I can now:
- Create a one-page, pick-by-pick cheat sheet for your draft slot (round-by-round conditional picks), or
- Generate a printable draft board (top 6–8 targets per round) based on the strategy you prefer.

Which would you like next?

You: that's all I need. thanks.
Agent: You’re welcome — glad to help. Files saved:

- /Users/irfanjamil/FF_Draft_Assistant/monte_carlo_draft_results.md  
- /Users/irfanjamil/FF_Draft_Assistant/ff_research_report.md (includes player notes and both draft strategies with your keepers)

If you want the pick-by-pick cheat sheet or printable draft board later, or want me to refresh player notes closer to your draft day, just say the word. Good luck — and if you share your live draft picks during the draft I can help with in-draft decisions.
